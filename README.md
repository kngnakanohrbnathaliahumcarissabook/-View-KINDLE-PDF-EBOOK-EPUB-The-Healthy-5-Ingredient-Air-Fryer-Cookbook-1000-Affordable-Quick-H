The Healthy 5-Ingredient Air Fryer Cookbook: 1000 Affordable, Quick & Healthy Recipes for Beginners and Advanced Users to Eat Healthily by Katherine R. Majeski Book Review

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars A good book for beginner to cook a great meal with simple steps and simple ingredients.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021
Review: I bought a air fryer for convenience on Thanksgiving, but I have no idea what kind of food could cooked in it. So, I purchased this recipe. It was so awesome that almost most of the recipe only need 6 steps with ONLY 5 Ingredients to cook and provide a few recipe for big party like (16-18 serves). Good for someone invite their friends to someone‚Äôs house for an party. Some of the recipes required baking pan, but my air fryer doesn‚Äôt included it ( I got my air fryer in great price even not include accessories yeah!). So, I use my own baking pan with aluminum foil to cook. Overall, it is a great book for people who never use air fryer because you don‚Äôt need to prepare too much ingredients and too much steps to make a great meal. I am going to cook scones in my air fryer (I really love to eat scone with a hot tea). Hope everyone enjoy to cook with it.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Can someone explain how they come up with 1000 recipes in this book?
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2021
Review: While I agree 100% with the comments, this is a great cookbook. Easy ingredients, simple directions‚Ä¶perfect for a beginner like me!
What is not, however is 1000 recipes! (Despite the fact it mentions 1000 recipes just on the back of the cookbook alone) I just can‚Äôt imagine how it comes up to 1000. I actually took the time to count up the index page and I come up with 367 recipes (give or take‚Ä¶I could have lost count), however I can absolutely testify to the fact that there are far fewer than 1000 recipes! If someone could explain the count, I would appreciate that!

Title: .0 out of 5 stars An awesome cookbook for airfryer owners!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2021
Review: I like the airfryer recipes because I always wondered how to cook food in an airfryer. I like that you included vegetarian recipes; I also like the cheeseburger and mozzarella sticks recipes.
As a critique, I suggest making the breakfast, lunch, dinners, desserts and vegetarian titles in the table of contents appear bolder and bigger than the recipes in order to differentiate them from the recipes. And I noticed that some of your recipes don‚Äôt have nutritional info so I suggest adding the nutritional info where it may be needed.
Anyway, I like this book very much and I find it very useful to have. I also think it would be very useful for those who have airfryers and want to make simple recipes with less effort involved and less time to make recipes.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Tasty and quick recipes for your air fryer
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2021
Review: I loved the vegetarian recipes for quick healthy snacks in an air fryer. The recipes are super easy to follow. Kale is my fav veggie, so I had to try the garlic parmesan kale chips recipe. I have had kale chips before, but this recipe brings a more flavorful touch. It is now a part of my go-to snacks. There are a variety of recipes for anyone with different eating preferences. I‚Äôm a vegetarian, so I loved seeing a lot of veggie choices for me to incorporate the air fryer recipes. There are dessert recipes to make in the air fryer, like pumpkin pie, brownies, and snickerdoodles, yummy. It is a stress-free cookbook for anyone who loves to eat and wants a quick and tasty way to make them.

Review: I haven‚Äôt made anything from the cookbook yet. There are so many typos, inconsistencies, and missing ingredients. It‚Äôs so distracting that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll keep this. I definitely don‚Äôt understand the 5 star reviews.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars I would buy 1000 times
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021
Review: Finally, an air fryer cook book worth keeping; I can testify that the most of the 5-star ratings here are genuine; this book is a keeper. 1000+ delectable and simple-to-make dishes! Simple and straightforward, with no need for exotic ingredients or a trip to the market to buy various components that you'll almost certainly toss away. The first chapter has a wealth of air fryer techniques and information! I've bought and returned a lot of books on air frying from Amazon and other places because they're not plain with easy-to-follow recipes that employ basic ingredients. I'm pleased I ordered it since it's a fantastic book!

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Love it!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2021
Review: This cookbook was one of the greatest purchases I have made. The recipes are super simple to follow, and I liked how they put all the needed ingredients before the directions. I hate flipping or scrolling through pages back and forth to double check what ingredients I needed. The nutrition information that they added was a nice touch, it is defiantly useful for someone who is trying to eat a certain amount of calories a day. Best of all, there are so many recipes to choose from, looking forwards to trying all of these out.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Great recipes missing ingredients
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022
Review: Alot of recipes are easy and taste great but some recipes are missing what is needed to make the recipe. One says mix mustard, etc in bowl but have no idea how much mustard to use or if it is dry or.not. Many recipes are like this.
